## Latex
# To make the booklet:
pdflatex booklet_sat


## To regenerate the tables from penta:
# get the data:
wget --no-check-certificate https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/xml

# make sure directory 'generated' exists:
mkdir generated

# update the chapters
./generate.py xml

## The script is smart enough not to overwrite files unless the relevant data changed (even when you modified the file in the mean time).
